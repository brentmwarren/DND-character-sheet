## About the project
This is probably the most amazing DnD character sheet you'll ever use. Really, it's bananas. Even if you don't like DnD, you're about to.

Our app was created for people who love DnD and for people who are just starting out. Elegantly designed, effective for real/fantasy world applications, and easy to use. This is for all your character needs in order to create, view, and organize all information needed for one heck of a campaign. We hope you enjoy it.

## Wish list/Future Development

-User can create a “campaign” for other players to join
-User who creates campaign is designated as “Dungeon Master” and can then view character sheets of players in the campaign
-User can create a description of the campaign story/background/etc.

-Guide to create characters. I.e. humans get xyz, background does this, class has that etc. 
-Provide options for fields (aka dice roll)
-Dungeon master functionality
-DM can enable or disable new characters joining a campaign
-Carousel displaying character sheets
-Users alignment/personality to affect background image when they are signed in (lawful good is an orderly castle, evil of some sort has a necromancer or lava in the background etc.)
